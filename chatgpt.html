                        <h6 style="text-align: left;">
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chat GPT is a type of neural network architecture called a transformer model that is specifically designed to process natural language. It is trained on vast amounts of text data using a process called unsupervised learning. This means that the model is not given any specific task to perform, but rather it learns to predict the next word in a sequence of words based on the words that came before it.

                        <h4 class="fw-bold text-success mb-2" style="text-align: left;">Pre-training</h4>
                        <h6 style="text-align: left;">
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the model can be used for any specific task, it must first be pre-trained on a large dataset of text. The pre-training process involves training the model to predict the next word in a sequence of words. This is done by masking out some of the words in a sentence and training the model to predict what those words should be based on the context of the surrounding words. The model is also trained to understand the relationships between words and the overall structure of language.

                        <h6 style="text-align: left;">
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the model has been pre-trained, it can be fine-tuned for specific tasks such as question answering, sentiment analysis, or language translation. Fine-tuning involves training the model on a smaller, task-specific dataset. During this process, the weights of the pre-trained model are adjusted to optimize its performance on the specific task.

                        <h4 class="fw-bold text-success mb-2" style="text-align: left;">How Chat GPT generates responses</h4>
                        <h6 style="text-align: left;">
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a user inputs text into Chat GPT, the model analyzes the input and generates a response based on its understanding of the context and structure of language. The model generates responses using a process called autoregression, where it generates one word at a time based on the probability of each word given the words that have come before it.<br><br>
                            Chat GPT is designed to generate responses that are both grammatically correct and semantically meaningful. It is able to generate a wide range of responses, from simple one-word answers to more complex and nuanced responses.

                        <h4 class="fw-bold text-success mb-2" style="text-align: left;">Limitations of Chat GPT</h4>
                        <h6 style="text-align: left;">
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Chat GPT is an impressive technology, it is not perfect. One of the limitations of the model is that it may generate responses that are inappropriate or offensive. This is because the model is trained on a large dataset of text that includes a wide range of language, including offensive and inappropriate language.<br><br>
                            Additionally, Chat GPT is not able to understand the context of a conversation outside of the immediate input and response. This means that it may generate responses that are not relevant to the overall conversation or miss the intended meaning of the input.

                        <h4 class="fw-bold text-success mb-2" style="text-align: left;">Summary</h4>
                        <h6 style="text-align: left;">
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chat GPT is a powerful technology that has transformed the field of natural language processing. Its ability to generate natural-sounding human-like responses has made it a popular tool for chatbots and other conversational agents. While the model is not perfect, its capabilities are constantly improving with ongoing research and development in the field of NLP.
